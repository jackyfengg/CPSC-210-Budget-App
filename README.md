# Budgeting Application
## CPSC 210 Jacky Feng 

***Project Description:*** My project is an application that will **help users manage their personal finances** by allowing them to create and manage budgets.
<br> Users will be able to input and categorize their revenues and expenses into personalized groups which will allow them to **visualize how much they spend, save, and take action**. <br>
In addition, users will be able to set up financial goals such as paying off student loans, mortgages, and bond amortization.

***Target audience:*** My application would be targeted towards **people who need extra assistance in financial planning or want to visualize their savings, expenditures, and financial goals**.
<br>An example would be graduating university students who want to visualize how much student debt they owe and how long it would take to pay it off given x revenues

This project is of interest to me as I have both seen and experienced how expensive it is to be a university student especially with rising food prices and housing costs.
<br>*Through this application I would be able to make better financial choices along with planning for the future*.
